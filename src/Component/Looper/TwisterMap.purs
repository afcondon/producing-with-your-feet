-- | The Twister's layout, printed in the Looper page's bindings panel.
-- |
-- | **Every word of it comes from `Data.Looper.Twister`.** Nothing here knows
-- | what any encoder does; it knows how to draw a four-by-four grid of things
-- | that describe themselves. Move a control and the card moves with it, which
-- | is the only way a printed layout stays true — a cheat sheet typed out beside
-- | the table it describes is right when written and wrong in the one place
-- | nobody thinks to check, because it is only documentation.
-- |
-- | The same lesson as `Data.Looper.Banks.auxLegend`, which exists because three
-- | screens in one day restated something that module already knew.
-- |
-- | ## The colours are a claim, not an observation
-- |
-- | The tones are what the app *asks* the device for, and no one has yet
-- | compared them with what it does (`DESIGN-TWISTER` §12). The card says so,
-- | because a legend that quietly presented an unverified intention as fact
-- | would be the thing to blame when a knob turns out to be the wrong colour.

-- | The card. Takes whether a Twister output is selected, which page the app is
-- | showing, which block the device last spoke from, and what to do about
-- | wanting a different page.
-- |
-- | **One page at a time, since 2026-08-27.** It printed both side by side, in
-- | a panel 1180px wide that covered the loops it was describing. Two things
-- | made that the wrong shape. The first is that you open this card to answer
-- | "what does *this* knob do" — a question about the page you are on, so the
-- | other page is furniture. The second is that the pager works now: turning
-- | the bottom-right encoder moves `showing`, so the card follows the device
-- | without anything here doing the following. Printing both pages was a
-- | workaround for a page turn you could not perform.
-- |
-- | What is left is narrow enough to read beside the loops instead of on top of
-- | them, which is the whole gain.
