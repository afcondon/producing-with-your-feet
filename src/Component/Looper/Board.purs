-- | The board, on screen, with every switch live.
-- |
-- | ## Why this exists
-- |
-- | **To take the MC6 out of the loop.** Debugging the looper surface has meant
-- | debugging two things at once: what the app does with a press, and whether
-- | the press arrived at all. Those failed together twice in one day and looked
-- | identical from a chair — a bank jump ate the CC beside it, so the board
-- | still navigated and every press *looked* like it worked while the app was
-- | never told which loop had been chosen. No amount of reasoning about the
-- | meaning table could have found that, because the meaning table was never
-- | reached.
-- |
-- | So: the same twelve switches, on the screen, clickable. If a press works
-- | here and not underfoot, the fault is in the wire or in what the device was
-- | programmed with. If it fails here too, it is ours. One bisection, and it
-- | costs a click instead of a session.
-- |
-- | ## It must be the same pipeline, not a similar one
-- |
-- | A button that called `Machine.act` directly would be a *second* input path,
-- | and a second input path agrees with the first right up until the moment it
-- | matters. So this emits the **MIDI bytes the MC6 would have sent** and hands
-- | them to the same handler the port feeds — through `decodeSwitch`, through
-- | `followBoard`, through the meaning table, out to the daemon. Everything
-- | between the wire and the sound is exercised; only the wire is skipped, which
-- | is exactly the thing being isolated.
-- |
-- | That also means this panel cannot drift into being a nicer interface than
-- | the pedal. It is a pedal simulator, and if a gesture is awkward here it is
-- | awkward there.
-- |
-- | ## Board order, not index order
-- |
-- | The MC6 numbers from the bottom: A B C is the near row, under your toes. A
-- | view that lays these out in index order is describing a board nobody is
-- | standing on, so the rows come from `Data.Looper.Banks.boardRows` rather than
-- | from a copy made here — the same fact, read from the same place as the
-- | device programming.
