-- | The MC6 banks for the six-loop looper, and the namespace they speak in.
-- |
-- | This is the build-time artifact of `itajara-in-atlantis` §"The MC6 is a
-- | keyboard": one bank per `BankSlot`, generated here and uploaded once — seven
-- | of them, which is as many as the CC arithmetic below has room for. Nothing
-- | rewrites
-- | them live, because relabelling a switch costs a preset upload of well over
-- | a second and the state of a loop changes faster than that. What each loop
-- | is doing is shown on the computer; the MC6 supplies twelve labelled places
-- | to put a foot.
-- |
-- | ## Every press says where it came from
-- |
-- | A switch does not send "record" or "loop 3". It sends **which switch on
-- | which bank**, and the app decides what that means. The whole meaning table
-- | is then in one place that can be changed without touching the hardware, and
-- | — more importantly — the app never has to remember which bank the board is
-- | showing. It is told, on every press.
-- |
-- | That is worth the CC space. If a press only said "switch 3", the app would
-- | have to infer the bank from its own memory of the last bank change, and the
-- | first missed message would put the two out of step permanently, with every
-- | subsequent press doing something confidently wrong. Here a stale bank
-- | arrives as a CC that does not fit the app's expectation, which is a thing
-- | you can *notice*.
-- |
-- | The arithmetic is deliberately readable in a MIDI monitor:
-- |
-- | ```
-- | cc = 16 * (bank slot + 1) + switch index
-- | ```
-- |
-- | so bank slots start at 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112 and a switch is the offset
-- | within the block — CC 51 is slot 2, switch D, at a glance and without a
-- | table. Four CCs per block go unused, which buys that legibility cheaply.
-- | CC 0-15 are left alone because CC 0 and 32 are bank select and the low
-- | numbers are where every other device's defaults live.
-- |
-- | ## Channel 9 is the app's own
-- |
-- | Taking a whole channel for "the MC6 talking to the app about its own
-- | switches" keeps this namespace from ever colliding with a message meant for
-- | a pedal. It is a control plane, not a pedal.
-- |
-- | **Nine, because it is the only one left, and that was checked against the
-- | device rather than against a comment.** This first shipped on channel 16 on
-- | the strength of a note in `Data.Looper` saying 9, 13 and 16 were free.
-- | Thirteen had since been taken by Itajara, and sixteen is **LoopyPro** — the
-- | device's own channel table says so, and its `sendToPort` is 2034 where every
-- | other channel is 2047, three ports masked off exactly as a channel routed to
-- | the iPad and nowhere else would be.
-- |
-- | The device's table, read from the August connect dump, is the authority:
-- | 1 MC6, 2 (Brothers), 3 MOOD, 4 Clean, 5 Hedra, 7 Flint, 8 Lex, 10 Iridium,
-- | 11 Riverside, 12 Mercury7, 14 Brig, 15 Habit, 16 LoopyPro — plus 6
-- | Lost + Found and 13 Itajara, which the app knows about and the device does
-- | not name. That leaves nine, alone.
-- |
-- | Note that the March backup has Habit and LoopyPro the other way round. They
-- | were swapped at some point between, which is precisely why a channel is not
-- | something to take on the word of a comment.
-- |
-- | Note the split from `Data.Looper.looperBank`, which is a different thing
-- | wearing a similar name: that bank drives the *single-loop* transport
-- | through Itajara's pedal CCs on channel 13, and stays as long as the old
-- | Looper page does. This is the six-loop machine, and it addresses the app.
-- |
-- | ## The device says which gesture, and the value says which
-- |
-- | **Tap, double tap and long press are recognised on the MC6, not here.**
-- | Measured on the device 2026-08-21 with the gesture probe in
-- | `Data.MC6.Diagnostics`, one CC per action, read off a MIDI listener:
-- |
-- | ```
-- | double tap   DoubleTap alone — no Release at all, three times out of three
-- | double tap   DoubleTapRelease alone — Release suppressed too
-- | long press   Press at press-down, then LongPress while held, and no Release
-- | press-only   Press at press-down, Release when the foot lifts, both instant
-- | window       under 414 ms: two presses that far apart read as two singles
-- | ```
-- |
-- | Which gives a **clean, mutually exclusive triple**: `Release` fires on a
-- | single tap and on nothing else, because a double takes `DoubleTapRelease`
-- | and a hold takes `LongPress`. Nothing has to be suppressed by hand and
-- | nothing overlaps.
-- |
-- | **The deferral is on the release, never on the press.** `Press` fires the
-- | instant the foot lands, on every switch, whatever else is bound to it. It is
-- | `Release` that has to be *decided* — is this a single tap's release, the
-- | first half of a double, or the end of a hold? — and so it is `Release` that
-- | waits, and that gets suppressed when the answer turns out to be something
-- | else. This is Morningstar's own advice to program the release on any switch
-- | that also carries a long press, arrived at from underneath. See
-- | `soleGesture` for the rule it implies and for what it buys.
-- |
-- | So the app stopped doing it. There was an `Data.Looper.Gestures`, a `Mealy`
-- | transducer timing the gap between a CC at 127 and the same CC at 0, and it
-- | was well made and it is gone. Its stated justification — the double-tap
-- | window should be a function of the grid, which the device cannot know — was
-- | real and never exercised: the window was a constant. What it cost was three
-- | failure modes the hardware does not have, all of which were met in one day:
-- | the **orphan release** (a bank jump on press means the release arrives from
-- | the bank you have already reached, so the pair never completes), the
-- | **phantom hold** (that orphan's timer firing a gesture nobody made), and the
-- | app and the board **disagreeing about a threshold** — 600 ms here against
-- | 700 there, so a press in the gap closed nothing and stranded a recording.
-- |
-- | ### The value carries the gesture
-- |
-- | The CC number still says which switch on which bank. The **value** says
-- | which of the three gestures it was:
-- |
-- | ```
-- | 127  tap        ActionRelease
-- |  64  double     ActionDoubleTapRelease
-- |   1  hold       ActionLongPress
-- | ```
-- |
-- | Three widely spaced values rather than three CC blocks, because the
-- | namespace is already spent — six banks of sixteen is ninety-six CCs, and
-- | tripling that does not fit. A monitor still reads it at a glance: CC 51
-- | value 64 is a double tap on slot 2, switch D.
-- |
-- | Decoding is exact rather than banded, which makes a board programmed by an
-- | older version *say so*: its release sends 0, which is on no gesture and gets
-- | logged instead of silently meaning something.
-- |
-- | ### A switch with no second meaning still answers a double
-- |
-- | This applies only to a switch that carries a *hold* but no double — one that
-- | is therefore on the release side. The device suppresses `Release` on a
-- | double tap whether or not anything is bound to it, so left alone a fumbled
-- | double would do **nothing at all**, which is a worse answer than doing it
-- | once.
-- |
-- | So `bindings` gives such a switch the *tap's* value on
-- | `ActionDoubleTapRelease`, and its jump with it. Two taps too close together
-- | come out as one tap, which is what the player meant. The table is untouched:
-- | `Duties.double` stays `Nothing`, the screen still says the switch has no
-- | second meaning, and the fallback lives in the one function that programs the
-- | device.
-- |
-- | A switch carrying **only** a tap needs none of this, because it is on
-- | `ActionPress` and two presses are simply two presses.

-- | The channel the MC6 uses to address the app about its own switches.
switchChannel :: Int
switchChannel = 9

-- | How far apart two banks' CC blocks sit. Sixteen rather than twelve so the

-- | nibble of the CC.
stride :: Int
stride = 16

-- | How many of the eight loops the **MC6** can reach.
-- |
-- | **This used to say "must equal `N_LOOPS` in the daemon", and it deliberately
-- | no longer does.** Six was the MC6's number — what it has underfoot without
-- | an FS3X — and `N_LOOPS` was set to match it. With the web page as the
-- | reference surface and the Twister as a second controller (`DESIGN-TWISTER`
-- | §1, §5) that reasoning inverts: the loop count comes from the instrument,
-- | and the foot reaches what it can.
-- |
-- | So this is a fact about the *device*, and `nLoops` is the fact about the
-- | *instrument*. Restoring the equality would give the app two ghost loops it

-- | resolves without overlap. It has more actions than this — `LongDoubleTap`,
-- | the scroll pair, the release halves of each — and every one of them is
-- | another thing to remember while standing on an unmarked switch. Three is

-- | takes `DoubleTapRelease` and suppresses the release; a long press takes
-- | `LongPress` and sends no release at all.
-- |
-- | The release halves rather than `Press` and `DoubleTap`, because the device

switchLetter :: Int -> Maybe String
switchLetter = Array.index
  [ "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L" ]

-- | The switches past the MC6's own six, as letter and label, for a given bank.
-- |
-- | **The display's only honest source for these.** The MC6's LCD names its own
-- | six switches and stops there; G to L are FS3X footswitches with no display
-- | and no markings, so the app has to say what they do — and it has to say it
-- | *for the bank the board is actually showing*.
-- |
-- | That last part was learned the hard way. The legend was a hand-written copy
-- | of the loop bank's six, shown unconditionally, so with the board on the
-- | config bank the screen said J was Clear while J was End Stop. Pressing it
-- | reported something about leaving-state, which reads exactly like a switch
-- | wired to the wrong place — and cost an hour looking for a reversed mapping
-- | that was never reversed.
-- |
-- | Derived from `layout` rather than restated, because a legend that can
-- | disagree with the table the device was programmed from is a legend that
-- | eventually will.

-- | The MC6's own six switches, in the rows they physically occupy.
-- |
-- | **The device numbers from the bottom**: A B C is the near row, under your
-- | toes, and D E F the far one. A view that lays out six things in board order
-- | must use this rather than index order, and it lives here because it is a
-- | fact about the hardware, not about any one screen — the loop grid got it
-- | wrong on its own, and the next screen to draw six switches would have got
-- | it wrong again, differently.
boardRows :: Array (Array Int)
boardRows = [ [ 3, 4, 5 ], [ 0, 1, 2 ] ]

-- | **The loops, four across and two down, on every surface at once.**
-- |
-- | This is the harmonisation, decided 2026-08-25, and it is a reversal worth
-- | stating plainly: the loop order used to be the *MC6's*, because the MC6 was
-- | once the only way to reach a loop and its switches number from the bottom.
-- | So loop 1 was switch A, on the near row, and the screen drew A B C below
-- | D E F to match.
-- |
-- | With eight loops and a 4×4 controller that tail is wagging the dog. The
-- | Twister's top-left encoder is loop 1 because that is what a grid of eight
-- | things obviously means, the page draws the same two rows of four, and the
-- | **pedal is the surface that has to fit in** — it covers the left three
-- | columns of both rows and simply lacks the fourth.
-- |
-- | Which is the shape an MC8 would fill exactly: four across, two down, loops
-- | 4 and 8 in the column the MC6 does not have. The layout is already waiting
-- | for it.
loopRows :: Array (Array Int)
loopRows = [ [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ], [ 4, 5, 6, 7 ] ]

-- | Which loop each of the MC6's six switches selects, by switch index.
-- |
-- | **The device numbers from the bottom** — A B C is the near row, under your
-- | toes, and D E F the far one — so the far row holds the *top* row of
-- | `loopRows` and the near row holds the bottom. Read it as the grid with its
-- | right-hand column removed and its rows swapped, because that is exactly
-- | what it is.
-- |
-- | ```
-- |   the page and the Twister      the MC6
-- |     1  2  3  4                    D  E  F      (far row)
-- |     5  6  7  8                    A  B  C      (near row)
-- | ```
-- |
-- | One table, both directions, so a switch and the letter printed beside a
-- | loop on screen cannot come to disagree. **Changing this needs the MC6
-- | re-uploaded**: the labels are compiled from it.
switchLoops :: Array Int
switchLoops = [ 4, 5, 6, 0, 1, 2 ]

loopAtSwitch :: Int -> Maybe Int
loopAtSwitch = Array.index switchLoops

-- | The two loops the six loop switches cannot reach, in the pedal's row order.
-- |
-- | **The fourth column, derived rather than written down.** `switchLoops`
-- | covers the left three columns of both rows; this is what is left — and it
-- | is `Array.last` of each row rather than the literal `[7, 3]` so that a
-- | change to `loopRows` moves both halves together instead of leaving one of
-- | them right and the other stale.
-- |
-- | Reversed for the same reason `switchLoops` reads bottom row first: the MC6
-- | numbers its switches from the near edge, so A is loop 8 and D is loop 4.
-- |
-- | These are the two the Grab bank aims at, and that is not a coincidence
-- | dressed as a design. Being out of the feet's reach is what made them the
-- | loops you set up rather than stomp, and material that arrives from the
-- | iPad is set up rather than stomped.
grabLoops :: Array Int
grabLoops = Array.reverse (Array.mapMaybe Array.last loopRows)

-- | Which switch on the Grab bank selects a loop, for the two that have one.
-- |
-- | **Derived from the layout's own shape, not from a second copy of it.** The
-- | targets sit in the left column of both rows — A and D — so the switch is
-- | three times the position in `grabLoops`, which is the one arithmetic fact
-- | `own GrabBank` and this have to agree about. A test walks both and checks
-- | they do.
grabSwitchForLoop :: Int -> Maybe Int
grabSwitchForLoop l = (\n -> n * (mc6OwnSwitches / 2)) <$> Array.findIndex (_ == l) grabLoops

-- | The input a grab loop records from, **by the name the daemon gives it**.
-- |
-- | Not a number. `src` is one-based over whatever `--source` flags itajara was
-- | launched with, so `src3` means the iPad only for as long as the flags stay
-- | in their present order — and those flags live in Bosun's registry, which
-- | this app never reads. A number here would be a coupling to a launch
-- | argument, silent when it broke, and wrong in the way that records four bars
-- | of the wrong room.
-- |
-- | A name is the durable half of the same fact. The daemon reports its sources
-- | with their names in every snapshot, so the lookup is live: if nothing is
-- | called this, nothing is sent and nothing is claimed.
grabSource :: String
grabSource = "ipad"

-- | Which switch selects a loop, or `Nothing` for the two the pedal cannot
-- | reach.
switchForLoop :: Int -> Maybe Int
switchForLoop l = Array.findIndex (_ == l) switchLoops

-- | One switch, as a view is allowed to see it.
-- |
-- | Opaque, and that is the whole point: **a view cannot make one up.** Three
-- | times in one day a screen restated something this module already knew — the
-- | six aux labels, the A-to-F letters, the physical row order — and each time
-- | the copy was right when written and wrong later. Types cannot stop somebody
-- | typing a word into a div, but they can stop a second *table* existing, and
-- | a second table is what actually rots.
-- | **The `Switch` view type was removed 2026-08-27**, with `switchKey`,
-- | `switchLabel`, `switchDouble`, `switchHold`, `faceAux` and `faceName`.
-- |
-- | They existed for one caller: the row under the loops that named G to L,
-- | because those are FS3X switches with no markings and nothing else could
-- | say. The board panel says it now, from `dutiesAt` and `dutyLabel` — the
-- | same facts by a shorter road, and pressable, which the legend never was.
-- |
-- | Left as a note rather than silently: `auxLegend` above is the surviving
-- | answer to the same question and is what four tests hold to.

-- | What the board is showing, as everything a view may say about it.
-- |
-- | `Nothing` is a real state and not a missing value: leaving for the board
-- | bank leaves the looper family entirely, and a face that kept naming the
-- | loop bank's switches there would be describing a board nobody is standing
-- | on.
newtype Face = Face (Maybe BankSlot)

face :: Maybe BankSlot -> Face
face = Face

-- | Which bank the face is, when it is one of ours.
-- |
-- | The one way out of the newtype, and deliberately so. A view that wants to
-- | draw the whole board needs the slot; a view that only wants to label a loop
-- | asks `faceLoopKey` and never opens it at all.
faceSlot :: Face -> Maybe BankSlot
faceSlot (Face m) = m

-- | What to print on a loop's slot: the switch that reaches it, or its number
-- | when the board is somewhere that cannot reach it.
-- |
-- | The letters are only true on the loop bank. With the board on config, A is
-- | Quantise — so labelling the first loop "A" there points a foot at the wrong
-- | thing, which is the same fault the legend had.
-- | What to print on a loop: the letter of the switch that selects it when the
-- | board is showing the loop bank, its own number otherwise.
-- |
-- | **Through `switchForLoop`, not through the loop's index.** Those were the
-- | same number until the surfaces were harmonised and are not any more: loop 1
-- | is switch D. Reading the letter straight off the index would print "A"
-- | beside loop 1 and send the foot to the wrong corner of the pedal — and the
-- | two would still agree perfectly on loop 5, which is the kind of half-right
-- | that survives testing.
-- |
-- | Loops with no switch have no letter; their number is the honest answer.
-- |
-- | **Two banks name loops now**, since the Grab page landed: the loop bank
-- | names six and the Grab bank names the two the loop bank cannot reach.
-- | Reading the letter off the wrong one is the same fault as reading it off
-- | the index — on the Grab bank, A is loop 8 and not loop 5 — so each bank
-- | asks its own table and every other bank still prints numbers.
faceLoopKey :: Face -> Int -> String
faceLoopKey (Face m) i = case m of
  Just LoopBank -> fromMaybe (show (i + 1)) (switchForLoop i >>= switchLetter)
  Just GrabBank -> fromMaybe (show (i + 1)) (grabSwitchForLoop i >>= switchLetter)
  _ -> show (i + 1)

-- | What one switch does, across the three gestures it can carry.
-- |
-- | `double` and `hold` are `Maybe` and mostly `Nothing`, which is a design
-- | position rather than an omission twice over.
-- |
-- | **It is a memory burden.** An unmarked switch is remembered as a position,
-- | and three meanings on every position is three times as much to hold while
-- | standing on it. Filling the surface because it is there is how a pedal
-- | becomes something you have to think about.
-- |
-- | **And it used to be a latency.** A tap cannot be known to be a tap until
-- | the double-tap window expires, so any switch that *might* be
-- | double-tapped answers a few hundred milliseconds late. Making it a `Maybe`
-- | lets the recogniser resolve instantly for the switches that have no
-- | double — which is most of them — instead of taxing every press for a
-- | gesture only a few carry.

  -- **Choosing a loop no longer opens anything**, changed 2026-08-30. It used
  -- to: choosing was opening its page, one act and one press, back when the
  -- page was where the verbs were. The verbs are on the toolbar now, on every
  -- bank, so the jump was taking you off the Loops page for nothing and the
  -- next loop you wanted was two presses away instead of one.
  --
  -- The working shape is to stand on Loops and stay there: press a loop, record
  -- it on `I`, undo with a double if it was not the one, press another loop.
  -- Its page is a hold away for the two things only it has.
  SelectLoop _ -> Nothing
  _ -> Nothing

-- | Whether this switch carries one meaning and nothing else.
-- |
-- | **The condition for using `ActionPress`, and it is exact.** Measured on the
-- | device 2026-08-21: the MC6 fires `Press` at press-down, unconditionally and
-- | for every switch — a press-only switch and a switch with all four actions
-- | bound both reported the instant the foot landed. So the deferral was never
-- | on the press. It is on the **release**, which is the message that has to be
-- | *decided*: is this a single tap's release, the first half of a double, or
-- | the end of a hold?
-- |
-- | Which gives the rule with a sharp edge: **a switch may use `ActionPress` if
-- | and only if it carries exactly one gesture.** Add a second and `Press`
-- | becomes a message that fires before the device knows what you meant — the
-- | tap runs, and then the hold runs on top of it. That is Morningstar's own
-- | advice to program the release on any switch that also has a long press,
-- | arrived at from underneath.
-- |
-- | The switches that qualify get their press for nothing: no double-tap window
-- | to wait out, no lateness to hand the daemon, and no fallback needed either
-- | — two presses in quick succession are simply two presses, which is already
-- | what a stepper wants and is harmless for everything else here.
soleGesture :: Duties -> Boolean
soleGesture s = s.double == Nothing && s.hold == Nothing

-- | Whether the device reported this the moment the foot landed.

-- | Read by the app to decide what to tell the daemon about lateness, and

-- | What a switch is for under a given gesture, when it is for anything.
-- |
-- | `Nothing` is a real answer twice over: most switches carry no hold, and a
-- | double on a switch with no second meaning is a fumble the device programming
-- | already turned into a tap (see the module header) — so a `Double` reaching
-- | here unbound means the board and this table have fallen out of step, which
-- | is worth saying rather than covering for.
dutyFor :: Gesture -> Duties -> Maybe Duty

-- |
-- | **Read from the same table the device was programmed from**, which is the
-- | only way the app can follow a bank change it did not command. Most of the
-- | navigation in this family is the MC6's own: a long press on a loop switch
-- | jumps to the config bank without a word to anyone, because that jump is a
-- | message stored *on the device*. The app sees the loop switch's CC and
-- | nothing else — so if it waits to be told, it is one press behind for ever,
-- | and the legend describes a bank nobody is standing on.
-- |
-- | It does not have to wait. It wrote the jumps; it can read them back.

-- | The six unmarked switches, and they are the same six everywhere.
-- |
-- | **This is a rule about feet, not about screen space.** G to L have no
-- | markings and no display; the only way to use them is to remember them, and
-- | memory of a footswitch is memory of a *position*. A switch that clears a
-- | loop on one page and sets an end-state on the next cannot be learned at all
-- | — you would have to know which bank you were on before you could know what
-- | your foot was about to do, which is exactly the thing a footswitch exists
-- | to avoid.
-- |
-- | So the family reserves them, and every bank spends its own choices on A to
-- | F, where the MC6 prints a label. That costs each sub-bank half its options,
-- | and the cost turned out to be nearly free: the reverse speeds were made
-- | redundant when direction became the sign of speed, and the rest of what was
-- | up here — the every-N counts, the leaving-states, momentary — is not
-- | implemented and had nowhere honest to sit anyway.
-- |
-- | `Back` is the one that changes destination: from the loops it leaves the
-- | looper entirely, and from anywhere else it goes home to the loops. Same
-- | role, same place, one press, from any depth.

  -- **The six the feet are best at, and nothing that duplicates the Twister.**
  --
  -- This used to be the six most-wanted looper duties, from a time when the
  -- MC6 was the whole surface. It is not any more: the Twister is on the board
  -- permanently, and Undo, Clear, Clear All, Capture, Save and the click all
  -- have encoders of their own on its first two pages. Keeping them here as
  -- well was not redundancy for safety, it was two places to learn and one of
  -- them slower.
  --
  -- What is left is what a *foot* is better at than a hand: the gestures that
  -- happen mid-phrase, where looking away is the cost. Arm and Record start
  -- takes; Reverse and half speed are the two that transform a loop in one
  -- press; Overdub adds a pass; the set stops and starts.
  --
  -- **The order is ergonomic and was measured with feet, not reasoned.** These
  -- are the FS3X switches, which are sloped and reachable where the unit's own
  -- six are neither, and `I` and `J` are the easiest two of the six — so they
  -- carry Record and the set. Arm sits on `G`, the hardest, deliberately: it
  -- waits for your note, so unlike Record its own timing does not matter. The
  -- best switch goes to the gesture that is late if you are.
  --
  -- **G's hold is the only way onto the Grab bank**, and it is here because
  -- there was nowhere else. The loop switches carry two gestures by decision
  -- and no third; `J` has all three already; and bank 0's gateway — which is
  -- where a jump like this properly belongs, per DESIGN-BANKS — is not built
  -- yet. So the family carries its own navigation for now, as it does for the
  -- way out.
  --
  -- `G` rather than any other switch for a stated reason: it is the one duty
  -- up here whose own timing does not matter, which the paragraph above says
  -- in order to justify putting Arm on the worst switch. A second gesture
  -- costs a switch its press-down report — the device has to wait out the
  -- double-tap window before it knows what you meant — and Arm is precisely
  -- the duty that can afford to pay it. Record could not.
  --
  -- It leads both ways, like `J`: from the Grab bank it goes back to the
  -- loops, so one switch shuttles between the two pages you actually use.

  --
  -- **One gesture each, and that is the point.** These carried three — tap to
  -- act, double to overdub, hold for config — and so had to be programmed on
  -- the release side, where the device waits out its double-tap window before
  -- it can say which one you meant. Every loop press in the rig was a few
  -- hundred milliseconds late, on the one switch where a few hundred
  -- milliseconds is a take.
  --
  -- Carrying one meaning, they sit on `ActionPress` and report the instant a
  -- foot lands. The verbs they used to carry are on `LoopPage`, one switch and
  -- one printed name each.
  -- **Not switch order — grid order.** Switch A selects loop 5, because A is
  -- the bottom-left switch and loop 5 is the bottom-left loop. See
  -- `switchLoops`.
  --
  -- **And a double undoes that loop**, added 2026-08-30. It costs the
  -- press-down report above — a switch with two meanings waits out the
  -- device's double-tap window before it can say which you meant — and the
  -- paragraph above is wrong about how much that matters: it is *Record* that
  -- has to answer when your foot lands, and Record is on `LoopPage` with one
  -- gesture of its own. Choosing a loop can afford to wait.
  --
  -- Undo rather than Clear, which was the first idea. Clear zeroes `redo_to`
  -- as well as the loop, so it is the one destructive act in the engine that
  -- cannot be taken back — and a fumbled double while choosing loops is
  -- exactly how you would find that out. Undo leaves the audio in place and
  -- `Redo` brings it back.
  -- **Two gestures and no more.** Choose it, or double to undo the last thing
  -- on it. There is nowhere for a hold to go: what the tap used to open is

  -- unreachable since choosing a loop stopped opening anything. Modes was the
  -- one whose loss costs nothing at all: one-shot, listen, chance, fade and
  -- decay each have an encoder of their own on the Twister's pages three and
  -- four, so the bank was a second, slower way to reach five things already in
  -- reach. Their duties are still in the tables below, unplaced.
  --
  -- ## What this bank is for
  --
  -- **Loops 4 and 8 are the fourth column** — the one the six loop switches
  -- cannot reach, because the MC6 is three across and the grid is four. That
  -- made them the two you *set up* rather than stomp, which turns out to be
  -- exactly the right shape for material that does not come from the guitar:
  -- a beat out of Patterning, a pad out of Xynthesizr, arriving on the iPad's
  -- pair of channels rather than through the pedalboard.
  --
  -- So this page aims at those two and nothing else, and the whole of the
  -- workflow is on it: pick which of the two, and grab a whole number of bars
  -- into it. Then leave, and make guitar loops against what you grabbed.
  --
  -- ## Why a grab is not just a recording
  --
  -- The iPad has to be playing, and it will not be until Link's transport
  -- starts — that is the only cue any of those apps takes. So `Grab` is two
  -- things at once: it starts the session and it starts a grid-quantised
  -- recording of the declared length. Both are waiting for the same downbeat,
  -- so the take begins on the drum machine's bar one rather than a bar and a
  -- bit into it.
  --
  -- **Two machines go in the two loops, and that is what the pair is for.**
  -- Both open on the grid always — see `Machine.gridded` — so their bar lines
  -- are the same bar lines and two beats grabbed one after the other agree
  -- about where one is.
  --
  -- A second grab into the *same* loop is an overdub, and it works, but not
  -- for this: an overdub starts at the play head rather than on a boundary
  -- (measured 2026-08-30, and the daemon says why — it writes from `origin`,
  -- so where the audio lands is already right), while the transport restarts
  -- the iPad at the next **bar**. A pattern longer than a bar therefore comes
  -- back rotated by however far into the loop you happened to be. Layering a
  -- second machine over the first, in phase, would need the transport
  -- scheduled for the loop's next *cycle* rather than its next bar, and that
  -- is a frame-deadline-to-Link-time join nothing here has yet.
  --
  -- ```
  --   far    Loop 4    4 bars    Halt
  --   near   Loop 8    8 bars    < Loops
  -- ```
  --
  -- `Halt` is the other half of the transport and has to be here: once the
  -- grab has closed, the iPad is still playing, and nothing else on this board
  -- can stop it. It stops the Link session rather than the looper, which is
  -- said in its long name because the difference matters — Ableton stops too.
