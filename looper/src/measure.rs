//! Round-trip latency measurement, and the routing map that comes with it.
//!
//! This exists before any looping code because of one fact: audio recorded
//! through an interface lands late by the full output→input round trip, and on
//! a looper **that error compounds on every overdub**. Layer three arrives
//! three round trips behind layer one, and nothing in the sound tells you it is
//! happening — it just gradually stops feeling like it is in time. Guessing the
//! number, or taking the interface's published figure, is not good enough,
//! because the figure that matters includes the converters, the buffer size in
//! force right now, and whatever is patched in between.
//!
//! So: emit a click, listen for it coming back, and count.
//!
//! The measurement is only as good as its clock. cpal hands each callback a
//! `StreamInstant` — for output, when the first frame of this buffer will
//! *reach the converter*; for input, when the first frame was *captured*. Both
//! derive from the host clock, so subtracting one from the other gives a real
//! interval rather than a difference of two callback-scheduling accidents.
//! Wall-clock timing at callback entry would be off by a buffer or more.
//!
//! **Every input channel is listened to, not just the one expected to answer.**
//! Two reasons, and the second is the important one. An interface with more USB
//! channels than jacks does not say which is which, so hearing the click name
//! its own channel is the cheapest possible routing map. And if the interface
//! has any internal monitoring path, a channel can hear the click with no cable
//! attached at all — which would otherwise yield a confident, precise, entirely
//! fictional latency. Listening everywhere makes that visible instead.
//!
//! Two paths are worth measuring and they are different numbers:
//!
//!   - **interface only** — a cable from an output back to an input. This is
//!     the floor, and the number to compensate a dry loop by.
//!   - **through the board** — output → pedalboard → input. This is the number
//!     that matters for anything recorded wet, and it is larger by whatever the
//!     pedals' converters add.
